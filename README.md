# Fuel-Prices-App
Aim of the application:
This is an application for collating competitor's fuel prices information for an organisation through their area managers. The area manager would access the app and enter details of competitors and their daily prices. The aim of the application is to mainly help forecourt traders collate reliable prices from their area manager to allow competitive pricing for both the organisation as well as their cumstomers.

Planning and limitations encountered throughout the project:
I started the project with clear vision, however, as during its development I encountered various challenges which are:
1. Branching within Github - I wanted to branch of into development from main and from development to freatures (create > read > update > delete), then merge onto developement from feeature. From development, create a new testing branch and perform unit tests (service class) and integration testing. This means the testing branch would have 2 commits and then merge back onto development and perform a final merge onto main at the end of the project as shown in the below link but unfortuntely while develop the app I was creating branch and checking into them but forfor to push after commiting. The testing aspect also took much that I thought so that impacted the over timeline of the project.

Testing took much more time than I thought and caring responsilites also meant I needed extra time to complte the project. For my next project I would allocate more time to the testing phase of my project.
